Gene Set Analysis tools for re-analyzing the gene set data of Fredrickson et al 2013 and 2015. There are 3 scripts. FredricksonReanalysis.R is the major script specific to the re-analysis of the data, including the bootstrap and permutation GLS. GSA1.R is the Monte Carlo script to measure error rates for the GLS and alternatives including GEE, Obrien's OLS test for multiple outcomes, Roast, GlobalAncova, a permutation r^2 test based on Anderson and a permutation F test that is a hybrid of Anderson and GlobalAncova. GSAMethods.R contains the GSA methods used throughout that aren't otherwise available in R (Obrien's, Andersons, Hybrid).
